# Introduction

This document presents three teaching principles, independent of one another. Here they are, in arbitrary order:
1. Practice precedes theory.
2. Teachers do not have to certify skills.
3. The most effective communication is between just two people.

# Practice precedes theory

As an example, consider the teaching of algebra, although what is said here also applies to any other subject of study.

In a university algebra course, these steps are usually followed:
* First, definitions of the concepts used in algebra are presented.
* Then, the main theorems used in algebra are presented, with possible proofs. These theorems make use of the definitions previously presented.
* Finally, algebraic problems are solved, making use of the theorems previously presented.

This order of exposition of concepts seems obvious, since, in order to solve problems, it is necessary to know the theorems to be used in such resolutions, and, in order to rigorously express theorems, it is necessary to have defined the concepts used by such theorems.

However, it will be agreed that this order of exposition proceeds from the abstract to the concrete.

In fact, mathematical definitions are at a high level of abstraction, that is, they are highly theoretical.
Mathematical theorems are still quite abstract, but at a lower level of abstraction than definitions; that is, they are still quite theoretical, but they are more pragmatic than definitions.
Finally, mathematical problems are less abstract than theorems, that is, they are more pragmatic than theorems and much more pragmatic than definitions.

Thus, often at the level of the entire algebra course, but at least at the level of each chapter of the textbook, we move from the abstract to the concrete, from theory to practice. We move from general cases to particular cases, from categories to examples.

However, the human mind does not work in this way. The mind is not able to assimilate definitions without already having clear the most important properties (i.e. theorems) of such defined concepts, and mind is not able to assimilate theorems without having clear some concrete examples (which appear in the problems) to which such theorems apply.

So, how is it possible that many people (but in reality not quite many) are able to understand mathematics, despite this psychologically inadequate approach?

This is possible thanks to three mechanisms:
* In primary school, elementary concepts are learned, which serve as examples for the more abstract concepts learned in middle school, which serve as examples for the more abstract concepts learned in high school, which serve as examples for the more abstract concepts learned in university. On the other hand, if every definition were immediately understandable, why the definitions used in university courses are not already used in primary schools?
* Those who have a good memory, when they hear a definition for the first time, they do not actually understand it, but they just memorize it like a magic formula. Then, when they see concrete examples, they recall to consciousness the memorized formula, and finally understands it.
* Those who do not have a good memory, when they hear a definition for the first time, they do not actually understand it, and quickly forget it, and are therefore just wasting time. Then, when they see concrete examples, they spontaneously imagine the concepts described in those examples, even if they do not have a precise definition in mind. Then, rereading the book a second time, they finally understand the definitions, which are nothing more than abstractions of the concepts conceived through the examples. Therefore, those who do not have a very good memory, which is almost everyone, have to read a math text several times to understand it. Almost no one can pass a math test by reading the text only once.

Here is a case that shows how examples are more important than definitions. A primary school teacher had always drawn triangles with one side horizontal and the rest of the triangle above this side.

One day, a triangle appeared with one side horizontal and the rest of the triangle below this side. Many students called it an "upside-down triangle".
Another day, a triangle appeared without any horizontal sides. Many students called it a "tilted triangle."
However, in mathematics, there are no inverted triangles nor tilted triangles.

Clearly, drawing triangles always with one side horizontal and the rest of the triangle above this side had generated an improper idea of ​​the concept of "triangle." The teacher should have drawn less particular triangles, that is, without horizontal sides.
Of course, any single triangle cannot be completely general. But it would have been enough to show half a dozen triangles, of various shapes. At that point, a formal definition would have been understandable.

In conclusion, any good course of mathematics should begin by showing a variety of very concrete examples of the objects of study, and show how to solve problems with those concrete objects.

After learning to deal with those concrete problems, with concrete methods, one can show properties that hold in all the cases considered. Such properties are theorems.

After learning those properties, one can generalize the objects seen, giving the definition of the set that includes all the particular cases, and which will therefore be the set of mathematical entities for which the already known properties hold.

All this also applies to other disciplines.

For example, in chemistry, instead of starting to talk about the concept of oxidation-reduction, one must present dozens of important chemical reactions, then classify them according to their characteristics, and finally give names to those classes of reactions.

As another example, in law, instead of starting to talk about the concept of crimes against property, one must present dozens of important crimes, then classify them according to their characteristics, and finally give names to those classes of crimes.

# Teachers do not have to certify skills

Many schools conduct proficiency exams. These exams typically take place at the end of the year, but also during the course of the year.

This occurs from primary school to university, with report cards and with final exams.

Some schools and professional associations have entrance exams. Here we will not talk about this type of exam, but only about the final or intermediate school exams.

Usually these exams are prepared, submitted and evaluated by the same teachers responsible for teaching.

It may make sense for teachers to test students' skills at the beginning, during, or at the end of a course to calibrate his or her teaching, keeping the results of these tests secret, that is, sharing them only with the tested students, or even with their parents, if they are minors, but not sharing them with the school institution or with other entities, except for statistical purposes, adequately anonymized.

Therefore, such "internal use" tests have no legal value, and do not certify skills to the rest of the world. They are simply a way of letting the teacher, the students, and their parents know the students' current level of skill, and possibly to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching.

However, transcribing the results of exams taken by the teacher himself into a document with legal value, such as an official register or a certificate, is inappropriate, for various reasons:
* Since the student's future depends on the teacher's assessments, the student will avoid asking the teacher objections or questions that may appear as a criticism of the teacher, but above all he will avoid asking for clarifications, as such requests could demonstrate the inadequacy of the student's preparation. All this compromises his learning opportunities, because the student will not have the opportunity to clarify his doubts, which will remain such.
* If the teacher has heterodox or simply incorrect opinions on his subject, he will tend to teach such ideas and verify their acquisition by his students, who will therefore learn a particular vision of the world, not in accordance with that of the rest of the population. If, however, the skills are assessed by an entity separate from the one that provides the teaching, there is a convergence of the educational objectives between the teacher and the examiner, since any divergences would compromise the success of the students in such exams.
* If the same person must deal with both teaching and certifying, he or she must dedicate time both to preparing as a teacher and to preparing as a certifier. Greater specialization entails greater professionalism.
* If during class time a lot of time is spent evaluating (i.e. questioning, submitting tests, presenting the corrections of the tests) little time can be dedicated to explanations.

In conclusion, there are three types of exams:
* Entrance exams
* Profit exams with secret or statistical results
* Profit exams with public results

Here it is asserted that the third type of exams, i.e. **profit exams with public results**, **must not be conducted by the same teachers who have imparted those teachings**.
In fact, it would not be unreasonable to even think that such exams should be completely abolished, leaving the assessment of skills to school entrance exams, professional certification bodies, and public competitions.

# The most effective communication is between just two people

The typical way of holding a school lesson, or a popular conference, or a scientific conference is that the speaker speaks for tens of minutes, without being interrupted, possibly showing projected pages or drawing on a blackboard, and at the end the listeners are given the right to ask some questions.
Here it is argued that this method of communication is ineffective.

## Live lessons to a community of listeners have some defects

When a teacher/speaker gives a lesson to a community of students/listeners, the following inconveniences arise:
* Some students arrive early, and therefore waste time waiting for the lesson.
* Some other students arrive late, and therefore miss part of the lesson.
* The teacher explains things that presume that they know what was explained in previous lessons, or even in previous schools, but some students do not know those notions, because those notions were not part of the program of the schools they came from, or the students had not been able or wanted to study them, or in any case had not understood them. So they do not understand this lesson either. Often such ineffectiveness of the lesson for such students also compromises the understanding of subsequent lessons, so that the student completely loses the sense of the entire course.
* On the other hand, sometimes, the teacher, realizing that several students do not have the requirements to understand the lesson in the program, interrupts the program, and repeats the lessons that should have already been learned. This is a waste of time for those students who had already understood and studied such lessons.
* Some students, for various reasons, may already have the knowledge/skills explained in a lesson, even if such notions were not part of the previous course of study. Again, such a lesson is a waste of time for those students.
* Some topics can be explained quickly, while others require more time. It is difficult to give a lesson of appropriate detail and complete meaning that lasts exactly as long as the time set for the lesson.
* When explaining something, a student may be distracted and not grasp a sentence, or due to his deficiencies, may not understand the meaning of such a sentence, or may need a slower and more concrete explanation. If the current explanation is maintained, that student will not understand. If sentences were repeated, synonyms were added, or phrases were reformulated, the explanation were slowed down, or examples were added, the explanation would be understandable to more people, but the lesson would be extended, and for some students this would be a waste of time.
* When a person has a curiosity, whether purely intellectual or aimed at solving a specific problem, that person is very interested and receptive to the answers given, and tends to memorize those answers. If, on the other hand, they have no interest in a question, they tend to have difficulty understanding it and to forget it quickly. Obviously, different students have different curiosities, and therefore a single lesson will not be able to satisfy everyone's curiosities.

## Recorded lessons are an improvement over live lessons

If a teacher records their lessons with a video camera, or even just an audio recorder, and students watch or listen to those recordings, there are significant improvements over live lessons:
* There are no early or late participation in lessons, nor distractions, because each student can choose when to start and when to stop watching the video, and can go back a few seconds to listen to the last sentence again.
* Each lesson can declare its prerequisites before the lesson and also during the lesson, and propose the recorded lessons that explain those concepts. Therefore, students who do not have those prerequisites can skip to the lesson that explains those concepts. Alternatively, when a student, listening to a lesson, realizes that it is too simple or too complex for his or her skills, he or she can stop listening and move on to another lesson.
* Any student who has not assimilated a lesson can listen to it again, as a review, while those who know it well can avoid such a review.
* Each student can choose the lessons that interest them most.
* There is no predefined length for a recorded lesson. Lessons can be of any length (although it is not recommended to exceed 60 minutes).

## Lessons to a group still have some flaws

We have seen that when giving a lesson aimed at a group of listeners, recorded lessons are better than live lessons.
However, recorded lessons also have various flaws, as the following cases can occur:
* A student does not understand some points of the lesson, and would need additional clarifications on these points, instead of moving on to another lesson.
* A student, in addition to some parts that interest him, finds himself listening to other parts that interest him less or that he already knows, and whose listening is therefore a waste of time.
* A student has specific curiosities, not covered by any lesson, or covered only within some lesson that is not easy to identify.

In summary, group lessons do not satisfy the specific needs of individual students.

## Individual lessons solve many problems

If instead of giving a lesson to a group of listeners, you give an individual lesson, that is, a lesson in which a professor addresses a single student, who has the right/duty to ask that his needs be satisfied, you avoid many of the inconveniences mentioned for group lessons:
* If the student does not understand some points of the lesson, he can interrupt the professor and immediately ask for clarification.
* If a student is hearing some aspects that he already knows, he can interrupt the professor, asking him to omit such explanations.
* If a student has specific curiosities, he can submit these curiosities to the professor, and obtain specific answers.

In all the cases mentioned, the professor himself can probe the level of knowledge and curiosity of the student, calibrating the explanation accordingly.

With individual lessons, the problems that remain are:
* The possible delays and advances in participating in lessons.
* The fixed time to dedicate to the lesson, when the student's needs would require less or more time than that foreseen for the lesson.
* The enormous time required by the professor to give individual lessons to all his students (or, equivalently, the enormous cost of individual lessons).

## Lessons between students solve other problems

We have seen that there are various types of lessons:
* Live lesson from a professor to a group.
* Recorded lesson from a professor and viewed by individual students.
* Interactive lesson from a professor to a single student.

There is, however, another possibility:
* Interactive lesson from a student to another single student.

Since in this type of lesson the teacher is not a professional teacher, we will call the professional teacher "professor", and simply "teacher" anyone who is teaching a student, whether a professor or another student.

Obviously, to give this type of lesson, the student-teacher must have learned the notions he is teaching well, but this does not mean that he must, in general, be at a higher level of study than the student to whom he is explaining the lesson.
For example, you could have two students studying the geography of European nations. First, one learns the chapter on France and the other the chapter on Germany. Then, the first student teaches France to the second student, and then the second student teaches Germany to the first student.

So, instead of receiving a lesson from a professor, each student can receive a lesson from another student, more knowledgeable than him on the subject of the lesson.

This technique offers advantages and disadvantages, compared to individual lessons by professors.

The advantages are:
* Each student could receive personalized teaching for a longer time, at the same cost (or, equivalently, for a lower cost, at the same time). For example, if the professor dedicated 20 hours a week to individual teaching, and each student dedicated only 2 hours a week to teaching, and there were 10 students for each professor, the total time dedicated to individual lessons given by students would be 20 hours a week, or equal to that dedicated to individual lessons given by professors. And therefore, on average, each student could receive double the individual lessons, that is, 2 hours from a professor and 2 hours from another student.
* When you teach, you reinforce your own learning. In fact, many students repeat lessons on their own, without anyone listening to them, precisely to reinforce their own learning. Therefore, these individual student-student lessons reinforce the learning of the student who gives the lesson, and not just of the one who receives it.
* When you teach, you realize which concepts have not been well learned. At this point, of course, you will have to ask for help from a third party. Otherwise, you risk not realizing that you have not learned everything you should know.
* In this way, relationships of collaboration, if not friendship, are established between students, who otherwise might remain isolated. This collaboration can also be useful for exchanging advice on how to continue your studies.

The disadvantages, however, are:
* In general, a student is not good at teaching here nto a professor, due to his limited knowledge of the subject.
* In general, a student is not as good at teaching as a professor, due to his limited knowledge of teaching.
* In general, a student is not as good at giving advice as a professor, due to his limited knowledge of academic and professional careers.

Therefore, individual lessons by professors remain indispensable, but they can be supplemented by individual lessons by students.

# Techniques to improve individual lessons

Here are some tricks to overcome the limitations mentioned above.

## How to avoid delays and advances to individual lessons

All students must always have some low-priority activity on their agenda: reading, writing, listening to or watching recorded lessons, taking tests.
These activities must be interruptible and resumeable from the point of interruption.

All students and professors are in the same environment, which can be a virtual environment, managed via a telecommunication system.

When a student needs a one-on-one lesson on a given topic from a teacher or another student, he or she sends a request to the class. If there is a free person who is able to give a lesson on that topic, that person is notified and the lesson can start immediately. Otherwise, the request of the student who needs the lesson is put on a waiting list, and the student can send another request. If no request can be fulfilled, the student starts doing a low-priority activity.

When a busy person finishes a lesson or other high-priority activity, he or she makes himself or herself available. At this point, if there is a lesson request that he or she can fulfill, and the requester is not busy, he or she can start the lesson as a teacher.
Similarly, if there is a lesson request of his or her own that can be fulfilled by another free person, he or she can start the lesson as a student.

When all the things requested by one person have been said, and the other person is able to respond, the lesson ends, without having to wait for a predefined time to elapse.

With this mechanism, people are prevented from wasting time waiting to speak to someone.

## Risks of one-on-one lessons and how to avoid them

There are some risks to this mechanism:
* A student may spend a lot of time teaching and therefore too little time studying or being taught.
* A student may spend too little time being taught by a professor, which are the most effective.

To avoid these risks, some limits must be set:
* A maximum value for the number of hours per week that each student can spend teaching. So, if a student has already reached that limit, for the rest of the week they should limit themselves to studying and being taught.
* A minimum value for the number of hours per week that each student can spend being taught by a given professor. So, if a student is much less than that limit, that professor should give priority to that student over other students.

## When a lecture should be given by a professor, and when by a student

As we have said, the most preferable lectures are certainly individual lectures given by professors, but such lectures are available in very limited quantities to each individual student.
Furthermore, recorded lectures given by professors and individual lectures given by other students have advantages and disadvantages.

This raises the question of when it is appropriate to resort to an individual lecture given by a professor, when to a recorded lecture given by a professor, when to an individual lecture given by a student, when to read a text, and when to write an essay.

When a student begins studying a subject, he should initially meet with a professor who sets up his study plan, advising him on the activities to be carried out, and in particular which recorded lectures to follow.

At this point, the student should alternate the various activities: viewing such recorded lectures, individual lessons on the same subject by other students, reading texts, writing essays.

More rarely, but with a certain frequency, the student should speak with the professor, asking for clarifications on the obscure points that have emerged since the last meeting, and advice on how to continue studying.

## Usefulness of competence tests

After listening to a lesson, it is possible that a student responds to a questionnaire (or test) aimed at certifying the understanding of the topics of the lesson.

This questionnaire has four purposes:
* Each topic can have specific requirements, and therefore, before starting a lesson on that topic, it must be determined whether or not a student has these requirements. Then the student will have to answer the questionnaires related to these requirements, and only if the answers are satisfactory, will he be able to receive a lesson on the topic that has these requirements.
* When a student needs a lesson on a topic, it is necessary to determine which students are capable of giving that lesson. Students who have answered the questionnaire related to that topic satisfactorily should be able to give a lesson on that topic.
* After a student has attended a lesson, he may have understood little from that lesson, and in that case he would need further explanations. The answers to a questionnaire on a topic allow to determine if further lessons are needed on that topic.
* Answering a questionnaire on a topic is a way to strengthen one's knowledge on that topic.

One aspect to take into account is the persistence of memory. Immediately after listening to a lesson, many details are remembered, but as the days pass, many memories fade. Therefore, to certify truly acquired skills, the competence test must be performed a few days or, better, a few weeks after having attended the lesson.
